# Arduino_sun_tracker_solar_panel

#####
    Configured a Servo motor to turn in the direction of the sun rays.

    The LDRs on the house indicate which direction the sun intensity is the highest and sends the signal to the servo to move in the direction of the sun.

    Components:
    3 LDRs
    Arduino
    10 K resistors.
    
    Concept : Voltage Divider
    
    Analog pins used  A0, A1, and A2.
